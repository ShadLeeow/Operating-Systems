Windows 10 has added the start button back. Click the window icon in the bottom left cornner, and you will see a familiar menu. The start menu shows commonly used programs and gives access to settings and power options. In addition to the menu also comes with active tiles. This looks is similar to the Tablet Mode. This is how a Start menu should look and act like.
